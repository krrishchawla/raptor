    "question": "What has been the trend in Apple's effective tax rate from 2008 to 2010, and what is the primary reason for the difference compared to the statutory federal income tax rate?",
    "answer": "Apple's effective tax rates decreased from 32% in 2008 and 2009 to 24% in 2010. The rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective rate in 2010 is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S."
