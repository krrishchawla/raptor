    "question": "What has been the trend in Apple's effective tax rate from 2008 to 2010, and what is the primary reason for the difference compared to the statutory federal income tax rate?",
    "answer": "The trend in Apple's effective tax rate from 2008 to 2010 shows fluctuations. In 2008, the gross unrecognized tax benefits were reported at $506 million, which increased to $971 million in 2009, and then slightly decreased to $943 million in 2010. The primary reason for the difference in Apple's effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal income tax rate is the reinvestment of foreign earnings. Apple's effective tax rate remained stable around 30% during this period, differing from the statutory federal rate due to the impact of reinvested foreign earnings. This strategic approach allowed Apple to benefit from lower-taxed global operations and various tax reform impacts, contributing to the difference in effective tax rates compared to the statutory rate."

    "answer": "In 2009, Apple's R&D expenses increased by 20% compared to the previous year. The company spent a total of $1.8 billion on research and development activities.

The company invested $1.8 billion in research and development, mainly to support expanded activities and higher headcount.
