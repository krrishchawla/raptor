    "question": "What were the primary drivers of the increase in Apple's cash balance between 2009 and 2010?",
    "answer": "The primary drivers of the increase in Apple's cash balance between 2009 and 2010 were the substantial deferred revenue from iPhone subscriptions and elevated operational cash flow well above net income. Additionally, the company's investments remained stable, largely in highly-rated securities, despite realizing net unrealized losses during this period. Apple's strategic financial adjustments, including the introduction of long-term debt issuance in 2010, also contributed to the increase in cash reserves. These factors collectively ensured ample liquidity to cover future operational needs and supported the growth of Apple's cash balance during the specified timeframe."

    "question": "What has been the trend in Apple's effective tax rate from 2008 to 2010, and what is the primary reason for the difference compared to the statutory federal income tax rate?",
    "answer": "The trend in Apple's effective tax rate from 2008 to 2010 shows fluctuations. In 2008, the gross unrecognized tax benefits were reported at $506 million, which increased to $971 million in 2009, and then slightly decreased to $943 million in 2010. The primary reason for the difference compared to the statutory federal income tax rate is the reinvestment of foreign earnings. Apple's effective tax rate remained stable around 30% during this period, differing from the statutory federal rate due to the impact of reinvested foreign earnings. This strategic approach allowed Apple to benefit from lower-taxed global operations and U.S. tax reform impacts, influencing the effective tax rate over the years."

    "answer": "In 2009, Apple's R&D expenses increased by 20% compared to the previous year. The company spent a total of $1.8 billion on research and development activities. This rise was primarily driven by increased headcount and software development costs. Despite the growth in R&D spending, it represented a smaller percentage of net sales due to a 52% increase in overall sales.\n\nIn 2010, Apple's R&D expenses continued to increase, this time by 34% to $1.8 billion. Similar to the previous year, the rise was mainly attributed to higher headcount and expanded R&D activities. However, despite the increase in dollar amount, R&D costs decreased as a percentage of net sales due to a 52% rise in overall sales.\n\nTherefore, from 2009 to 2010, Apple's R&D expenses increased by 34% in dollar amount, remaining at $1.8 billion, but decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant increase in overall sales."
