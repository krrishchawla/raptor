    "question": "Which company had the highest percentage of net sales spent on research and development costs in a single year between 2015-2018? What was the percentage and year?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the company with the highest percentage of net sales spent on research and development (R&D) costs in a single year between 2015-2018 is not explicitly mentioned. However, the context does provide detailed information about R&D expenses and net sales growth for the years 2010 and 2011, but not for the years 2015-2018.\n\nTo determine the highest percentage of net sales spent on R&D costs between 2015-2018, we would need specific data on both R&D expenses and net sales for those years, which is not provided in the context. The context only mentions a gradual increase in R&D expenditures from $45.2 million in 2015 to $48.3 million in 2017, but it does not provide the corresponding net sales figures or the percentage of net sales spent on R&D for those years.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to accurately determine which company had the highest percentage of net sales spent on R&D costs in a single year between 2015-2018, nor the exact percentage and year. Additional data on net sales for the years 2015-2018 would be required to answer this question definitively."
