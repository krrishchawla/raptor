    "question": "How did Analog Devices manage its interest rate exposure in 2009?",
    "answer": "In 2009, Analog Devices, Inc. managed its interest rate exposure through the use of derivative instruments, specifically interest rate swaps. These swaps were employed to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. By converting $650 million of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances from fixed to floating rates at a cost of $128 million, the company effectively managed its interest rate exposure. This strategic move was in line with the company's broader financial management practices, which included maintaining compliance with debt covenants and handling long-term debt maturities. The use of these derivative instruments was in adherence to Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 133, which governs the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities."

    "question": "What was the change in Analog Devices' uncertain tax positions balance from 2008 to 2009?",
    "answer": "The balance of Analog Devices' uncertain tax positions increased significantly from $9.889 million in 2007 to $18.161 million in 2009. This indicates a substantial rise in the company's uncertain tax positions over this period, reflecting growing concerns over tax-related matters.

    "question": "How did CDW Corporation's diluted weighted-average shares change from 2012 to 2014?",
    "answer": "From 2012 to 2014, CDW Corporation's diluted weighted-average shares experienced notable changes primarily due to the company's IPO and the exercise of the overallotment option by underwriters in 2013. Here is a detailed breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. **2012**: The financial data for 2012 is not explicitly provided in the context, but it can be inferred that the diluted weighted-average shares were lower compared to the subsequent years due to the absence of the IPO-related share issuance.\n\n2. **2013**: In 2013, CDW Corporation issued a substantial number of common shares during its IPO on July 2, 2013, where 23,250,000 shares were issued at $17 each. Additionally, the underwriters exercised their overallotment option, further increasing the number of shares. These newly issued shares were partially included in the 2013 denominator for calculating diluted EPS, with full reflection expected in 2014. The company also included restricted stocks and stock options in the diluted EPS calculation, excluding any shares that would have been anti-dilutive. This led to an increase in the diluted weighted-average shares for 2013.\n\n3. **2014**: By 2014, the full impact of the shares issued during the 2013 IPO and the overallotment option was reflected in the diluted weighted-average shares. The context indicates that the weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding was 96.1 million in 2014. Although the exact number of diluted shares for 2014 is not provided, it can be inferred that the diluted weighted-average shares would be higher than the basic shares due to the inclusion of additional equity-based compensation awards and other dilutive securities.\n\nOverall, the diluted weighted-average shares increased from 2012 to 2014, with a significant rise in 2013 due to the IPO and the exercise of the overallotment option, and a full reflection of these changes in 2014."

    "question": "What was the trend in Apple's future minimum lease payments from 2013 to 2014?",
    "answer": "The trend in Apple's future minimum lease payments from 2013 to 2014 showed an overall increase. As of September 28, 2013, Apple's future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases were projected to reach $4.721 billion. By 2014, this amount had increased to $5.0 billion. This indicates that Apple's commitments to future lease payments grew during this period. Additionally, the data suggests that while annual lease payments were expected to decrease gradually from 2015 to 2019, there was a significant jump in payments due thereafter. This trend reflects Apple's expanding retail presence and other operational needs, leading to higher long-term lease obligations."

    "question": "How did the assumptions in Cadence Design Systems' Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options change from 2007 to 2012?",
    "answer": "The context provided does not explicitly mention Cadence Design Systems or detail the specific assumptions used by Cadence Design Systems in their Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options from 2007 to 2012. However, it does provide information on the general trends and changes in assumptions used by companies in their Black-Scholes models over various periods.\n\nTo answer the question based on the given context, we can infer the following general trends in assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options from 2007 to 2012:\n\n1. **Risk-Free Interest Rates**: There was a significant decline in risk-free interest rates from 2007 to 2009, dropping from 4.84% in 2007 to 1.01% in 2009. This trend suggests that companies, including Cadence Design Systems, likely experienced lower risk-free interest rates during this period.\n\n2. **Expected Volatility**: The expected volatility increased notably from 39.8% in 2007 to 67.2% in 2009. This indicates that companies might have adjusted their volatility assumptions upwards during this period due to market conditions.\n\n3. **Dividend Yields**: The context mentions dividend yields for State Street, which varied slightly over the years 1999 to 2001. While specific data for Cadence Design Systems is not provided, it is reasonable to assume that dividend yields could have fluctuated based on market conditions and company policies.\n\n4. **Expected Term of Options**: The context mentions that American Tower Corporation extended the expected life of options to 6.25 years in 2005. While specific data for Cadence Design Systems is not provided, companies often adjust the expected term of options based on historical exercise patterns and employee behavior.\n\n5. **Other Assumptions**: The context also highlights the importance of precise assumption models like the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model, which incorporates various key assumptions such as volatility, risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, and the expected term of the options.\n\nIn summary, while the specific assumptions used by Cadence Design Systems from 2007 to 2012 are not detailed in the provided context, we can infer that there were likely adjustments in risk-free interest rates (generally decreasing), expected volatility (generally increasing), and possibly other factors such as dividend yields and the expected term of options, in line with broader market trends and company-specific conditions."

However, it does provide some historical data and trends related to the company's pension and post-retirement benefit plans.\n\nFrom the context, we know that:\n- The expected long-term return on plan assets was adjusted down to 6.75% for 2015 from 7.00% in 2014.\n- Historically, the expected long-term return on plan assets has been maintained at 8.25%, reflecting qualitative judgments based on past asset performance and future expectations.\n- There have been adjustments to the expected long-term returns on assets over the years, influenced by historical returns and future projections.\n\nGiven this historical trend of adjusting the expected rate of return based on market conditions and other factors, it is reasonable to infer that Eli Lilly likely continued to adjust its expected rate of return on plan assets from 2020 to 2023 in response to changing economic conditions, market performance, and actuarial assumptions. However, without specific data for those years, we cannot provide the exact figures or a detailed trend for the expected rate of return from 2020 to 2023."

In contrast, the acquisition of BioLucent in 2007 had a more focused allocation on developed technology, customer relationships, and trade name, with a significant portion attributed to goodwill. The strategic focus of the BioLucent acquisition was on enhancing Hologic's mammography and breast care business, reflecting a more targeted approach in the allocation of intangible assets."

    "question": "How did General Mills' share repurchase activity change from 2005 to 2006?",
    "answer": "General Mills' share repurchase activity saw a notable increase from 2005 to 2006. In fiscal 2005, the company repurchased 17 million shares for $771 million. This activity intensified in fiscal 2006, with the company buying back 19 million shares for $892 million. This represents an increase of 2 million shares and an additional expenditure of $121 million compared to the previous year.\n\nThe share repurchase program in 2006 was part of a broader strategy authorized for up to $4.5 billion, aimed at reacquiring shares over a 36-month period. This program followed an earlier $4 billion buyback completed under the 2005 stock repurchase program. The significant repurchases in 2006, particularly in the October to December timeframe, reflect the company's ongoing confidence and strategic management in enhancing shareholder value.\n\nAdditionally, the company scaled back its share repurchase program towards the end of 2006 but planned to spend $175 million in repurchases and reduce debt by more than $125 million in 2007. This strategic approach indicates a balanced focus on both returning value to shareholders through repurchases and managing the company's debt levels effectively."

    "answer": "The change in Advance Auto Parts' allowance for doubtful accounts from 2015 to 2016 can be analyzed by looking at the balances at the end of each year and the transactions that occurred during the period.\n\nAt the end of 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $16,152 thousand. By the end of 2016, this balance had increased to $29,164 thousand. This represents an increase of $13,012 thousand over the year.\n\nTo break it down further:\n- At the beginning of 2016, the balance was $16,152 thousand.\n- During 2016, $24,597 thousand was charged to expenses.\n- During the same period, $21,191 thousand was deducted, primarily due to accounts written off.\n\nThe net increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for 2016 is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Charges to Expenses} - \\text{Deductions} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = 24,597 - 21,191 = 3,406 \\text{ thousand} \\]\n\nHowever, the overall change from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016 is:\n\\[ \\text{Change in Balance} = \\text{Ending Balance 2016} - \\text{Ending Balance 2015} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Change in Balance} = 29,164 - 16,152 = 13,012 \\text{ thousand} \\]\n\nTherefore, the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by $13,012 thousand from 2015 to 2016."

    "question": "What was the trend in The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Value-at-Risk (VaR) for foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts from 2008 to 2009?",
    "answer": "The trend in The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Value-at-Risk (VaR) for foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts from 2008 to 2009 showed an increase in the potential risk exposure. Specifically, the calculated VaR for foreign exchange contracts ranged from $14.2 million to $28.4 million, with an average VaR of $21.6 million. For interest rate contracts, the VaR ranged from $23.0 million to $34.3 million, with an average VaR of $29.5 million. This indicates that both the high and low VaR values for these contracts increased, reflecting heightened volatilities in the market during that period. The company managed these risks by implementing strict counterparty credit guidelines and did not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements that would significantly impact their financial status."
