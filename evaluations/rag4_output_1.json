    "question": "Which company had the highest percentage of net sales spent on research and development costs in a single year between 2015-2018? What was the percentage and year?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the company with the highest percentage of net sales spent on research and development (R&D) costs in a single year between 2015-2018 is not explicitly mentioned. The context primarily focuses on the years 2010 and 2011, with some references to earlier years and a brief mention of R&D expenditures from 2015 to 2017 without specific percentages of net sales.\n\nHowever, the context does provide detailed information about the company's R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years 2010 and 2011. In 2010, R&D expenses increased by 34% to $1.8 billion, and in 2011, R&D expenses increased by 36%. Despite these increases, the R&D expenses represented a smaller percentage of net sales due to significant growth in net sales (52% in 2010 and 66% in 2011).\n\nTo determine the highest percentage of net sales spent on R&D costs between 2015-2018, additional specific data on the net sales and R&D expenses for those years would be required, which is not provided in the context. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer which company had the highest percentage of net sales spent on R&D costs in a single year between 2015-2018."

Additional data specifically detailing advertising expenses relative to net sales for the companies in question during the specified period would be required to provide a definitive answer."
