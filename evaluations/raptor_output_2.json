    "question": "For manufacturing companies headquartered in the United States, which company had the largest increase in the number of shares repurchased between 2017 and 2018?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the company that had the largest increase in the number of shares repurchased between 2017 and 2018 is not explicitly named. However, we can infer from the data that the company engaged in significant share repurchase activities during these years.\n\nIn 2017, the company repurchased shares as part of various plans, but specific numbers for the entire year are not detailed in the context. For 2018, the context provides more detailed information:\n\n- **December 2018:** 912,360 shares repurchased at $53.93 per share.\n- **Between December 2, 2018, and December 29, 2018:** 1,327,657 shares repurchased at $42.61 per share.\n- **Total shares repurchased from October to December 2018:** 2,723,347 shares, with 2,620,987 from announced plans.\n\nTo determine the largest increase, we need to compare the total number of shares repurchased in 2017 with those in 2018. The context does not provide the total number of shares repurchased in 2017, but it does indicate significant repurchase activities in 2018.\n\nGiven the detailed numbers for 2018, it is clear that the company repurchased a substantial number of shares, particularly in the last quarter of the year. If we assume that the repurchase activities in 2017 were less than those in 2018, we can infer that the company had a significant increase in the number of shares repurchased between these two years.\n\nTherefore, while the specific name of the company is not provided, the company described in the context had a notable increase in share repurchases from 2017 to 2018, particularly highlighted by the detailed repurchase activities in the last quarter of 2018."

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the company with the longest average remaining lease term for its top tenants as of the most recent annual report appears to be American Tower.

Additionally, properties like 625 Madison Avenue and 1185 Avenue of the Americas have significant lease payments with term expirations in the 2020s and options for further renewal, indicating long-term commitments.\n\nWhile other companies like Vornado Realty Trust and SL Green Realty also have long-term leases and significant financial commitments, the specific mention of long-term leases favored by broadcasters and the detailed future minimum rental receipts from non-cancelable operating lease agreements in American Tower's reports suggest that American Tower has the longest average remaining lease term for its top tenants."
