    "question": "How did Analog Devices manage its interest rate exposure in 2009?",
    "answer": "In 2009, Analog Devices, Inc. managed its interest rate exposure through the use of derivative instruments, specifically interest rate swaps. These swaps were employed to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. By converting $650 million of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances from fixed to floating rates at a cost of $128 million, the company effectively managed its interest rate exposure. This strategic financial maneuver allowed Analog Devices to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on its debt obligations, ensuring more predictable financial outcomes. Additionally, the company maintained compliance with FAS No. 133, which governs the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities."

    "question": "How did CDW Corporation's diluted weighted-average shares change from 2012 to 2014?",
    "answer": "From 2012 to 2014, CDW Corporation's diluted weighted-average shares experienced notable changes primarily due to the company's IPO and the exercise of the overallotment option by underwriters in 2013. Here is a detailed breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. **2012**: The financial data for 2012 is not explicitly provided in the context, but it can be inferred that the diluted weighted-average shares were lower compared to the subsequent years due to the absence of the IPO-related share issuance.\n\n2. **2013**: In 2013, CDW Corporation issued a substantial number of common shares during its IPO and through the exercise of the overallotment option by underwriters. These newly issued shares were partially included in the 2013 denominator for calculating diluted earnings per share (EPS). Additionally, the company included restricted stocks and stock options in the diluted EPS calculation, while excluding shares that would have been anti-dilutive. This led to an increase in the diluted weighted-average shares for 2013.\n\n3. **2014**: By 2014, the full impact of the shares issued during the 2013 IPO and the overallotment option was fully reflected in the diluted weighted-average shares. The context indicates that the weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding slightly declined from 96.1 million in 2014 to 95.8 million in 2016, suggesting a relatively stable but slightly decreasing trend in the number of shares. The diluted shares followed a similar trend, with the company excluding anti-dilutive stock options from the calculation.\n\nIn summary, CDW Corporation's diluted weighted-average shares increased significantly in 2013 due to the IPO and the exercise of the overallotment option, and this increase was fully reflected in 2014. The overall trend from 2012 to 2014 shows an increase in diluted weighted-average shares, primarily driven by the equity restructuring activities associated with the IPO."

    "question": "How did the assumptions in Cadence Design Systems' Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options change from 2007 to 2012?",
    "answer": "The context provided does not specifically mention Cadence Design Systems or detail the assumptions used in their Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options from 2007 to 2012. However, it does provide information on the general trends and changes in assumptions used by various companies over different periods.\n\nTo answer the question based on the available context, we can infer the following general trends in the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options from 2007 to 2012:\n\n1. **Risk-Free Interest Rates**: There was a significant decline in risk-free interest rates from 2007 to 2009, with rates dropping from 4.84% in 2007 to 1.01% in 2009. This trend suggests that companies, including Cadence Design Systems, might have experienced lower risk-free interest rates during this period.\n\n2. **Expected Volatility**: The expected volatility increased notably from 39.8% in 2007 to 67.2% in 2009. This indicates that companies might have adjusted their volatility assumptions upwards during this period due to market conditions.\n\n3. **Dividend Yields**: The context mentions stable dividend yields for State Street during 1999 to 2001, but does not provide specific information for the period from 2007 to 2012. However, companies typically adjust dividend yield assumptions based on their dividend policies and market conditions.\n\n4. **Expected Term of Options**: The expected term of options can vary based on company policies and market conditions. For example, American Tower Corporation extended the expected life of options to 6.25 years in 2005. This suggests that companies might adjust the expected term based on strategic decisions and market trends.\n\n5. **Other Assumptions**: The context also mentions the use of historical data and projections in the Black-Scholes model, emphasizing the importance of precise assumption models. Companies might adjust other assumptions such as stock price volatility and dividend yields based on their specific circumstances and market conditions.\n\nIn summary, while the context does not provide specific details for Cadence Design Systems from 2007 to 2012, it suggests that companies generally experienced lower risk-free interest rates and higher expected volatility during this period. These changes would likely have influenced the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options."

    "answer": "From 2006 to 2007, ConAgra Brands' consumer foods segment experienced a mixed performance in terms of sales volume and gross profit. In fiscal year 2006, the consumer foods segment saw a net sales decrease by $94 million to $6.5 billion, driven by a 1% decline in sales volume. This decline was attributed to flat performance in the top thirty brands and sales declines in brands like Hunt's and Wesson, which offset growth in other brands.\n\nIn contrast, fiscal year 2007 saw an improvement in the consumer foods segment. Sales growth and improved operating profits were driven by better pricing and efficiencies, despite higher raw material costs. The consumer packaging net sales showed strong growth, increasing by 12% over 2006. This indicates that while the sales volume may have remained relatively flat or experienced minor fluctuations, the gross profit improved due to better pricing strategies and operational efficiencies.\n\nOverall, from 2006 to 2007, ConAgra Brands' consumer foods segment saw a decline in sales volume in 2006 but managed to improve gross profit in 2007 through better pricing and operational efficiencies."

    "question": "What was the trend in The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Value-at-Risk (VaR) for foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts from 2008 to 2009?",
    "answer": "The trend in The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Value-at-Risk (VaR) for foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts from 2008 to 2009 showed an increase in the potential risk exposure for both types of contracts. Specifically, the calculated VaR for foreign exchange contracts ranged from $14.2 million to $28.4 million, with an average VaR of $21.6 million. For interest rate contracts, the VaR ranged from $23.0 million to $34.3 million, with an average VaR of $29.5 million. This indicates that the company experienced higher volatilities in both foreign exchange and interest rate markets during this period, leading to increased potential losses as assessed by their VaR models."
